It will be really fast, powered by a Pi 4 for calculations, and supports automatic multicolor printing, auto print removal, and auto bed leveling within a big build volume (310x310x380 mm). Built on a tight budget in India over 75+ hours with mood swings and intense learning experiences in both Cartesian and CoreXY systems."
